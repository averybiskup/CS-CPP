1.
Well, "this" is a pointer to it's own class.
We can't just user the variable name, because
they are defined as something else in that scope

2.

These two variables are inherited from Shape class
So we can use the arrow function to access them

3.

Virtual allows methods in the parent class to be
overwritten by methods in classes that inherit from it.

"= 0" makes that class abstract meaning that it can't
be initialized, so we have to create a child class in order
initialize it.


4.

This initializes the parent class with x and y, so
Circle has something to inherit from

If you remove it, Circle can't inherit x and y from it.
It won't compile


5.

line 33 of GridWriter.cpp takes a reference to a Shape as the argument

You can pass in any classes that inherit from Shape, so it's polymorphic.
